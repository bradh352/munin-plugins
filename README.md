arris_cablemodem
----------------

Monitor cable modem statu for SB8200.  Utilizes multigraph capabilities. 
Automatically detects channels and saves a state file for the config for
durations where the cable modem is inaccessible.

This may also work with the SB6183 as it appears the web interface is the
same but I have not tested it.
